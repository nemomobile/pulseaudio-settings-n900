# FIXME: It would be a bit nicer to have the sink/source name and the rate
# configuration in the profile set configuration file, but there's no support
# for that at the moment. Or at least the rate should be in the profile set
# config - the best situation would be if the UI parts didn't depend on the
# sink/source names, in which case the sink and source names wouldn't need to
# be configured anywhere at all.
#
# FIXME: It would be really nice to not have tsched=0, but currently
# module-meego-voice seems to rely on a specific fragment size, at least for
# call uplink. That should be fixable (probably not easy, though). It would be
# helpful if it was possible to disable tsched only for the source, if it's not
# necessary for the sink. There's no support for that in the profile set
# configuration file, but adding that should be quite easy.

# is to move to separate and independent configuration files for hardware
# adaptation and UI at some point.) I haven't actually tried what happens if
# module-meego-cmtspeech is loaded before module-meego-voice, it may even
# work... So, this may actually be easy to fix, don't be afraid to try...
